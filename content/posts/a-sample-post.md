Working from memory as I type this on my phone over dinner.

Using vim on Termux for Android. I haven't dug too deeply into its capabilities, but it seems to be a full-featured terminal supporting bash and zsh - complete with the usual linux tools like top, ps, chmod, etc. I've managed to install git and clang, so definitely not a toy.

In my head, I'm already working on utility scripts I can write in order to ameliorate some of the problems with working on my phone - many of them git-related. After all, if I can get git working smoothly, I can do a lot of the heavy lifting on my PC and then push the result to my phone for the bits that need to be done locally on Android. (At what point in this journal did I switch from Termux to editing in Chrome on the Github site? I'll never tell.)

Honestly, I was never as excited about writing apps for Android as I am about the possibility of writing command-line utilities.
